> **Abstract:** *Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks when trained offline. However, in a Continual Learning (CL) scenario where new data is introduced progressively, models still suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Retraining a model from scratch to adapt to newly generated data is time-consuming and inefficient. Previous approaches suggested re-purposing self-supervised objectives with knowledge distillation to mitigate forgetting across tasks, assuming that labels from all tasks are available during fine-tuning. In this paper, we generalize self-supervised continual learning in a practical setting where available labels can be leveraged in any step of the SSL process. With an increasing number of continual tasks, this offers more flexibility in the pre-training and fine-tuning phases. With Kaizen, we introduce a training architecture that is able to mitigate catastrophic forgetting for both the feature extractor and classifier with a carefully designed loss function. By using a set of comprehensive evaluation metrics reflecting different aspects of continual learning, we demonstrated that Kaizen significantly outperforms previous SSL models in competitive vision benchmarks, with up to 16.5% accuracy improvement on split CIFAR-100. Kaizen is able to balance the trade-off between knowledge retention and learning from new data with an end-to-end model, paving the way for practical deployment of continual learning systems.*

# Installation
Please run the following command to install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In order to work with the [WandB](https://wandb.ai/site) logging library, you may need to run the following:
```
source setup_commands.sh
```

# Commands

Bash files for launching the experiments are provided in the `bash_files` folder. Using the `job_launcher.py` can launch experiments which automatically train a model continually for the number of tasks specified in the corresponding bash file.

For example, to launch the MoCoV2+ experiment, run:

```
DATA_DIR=/YOUR/DATA/DIR/ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python job_launcher.py --script bash_files/mocov2plus_cifar_distill_classifier_l1000_soft_label_replay_0.01_b32.sh
```

Note that it is the default behaviour of each script to use gpu:0, so setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` environment variable allows control over which gpu to be used by the script.
